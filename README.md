## Why is it Important to us?
We believe saving the environment is the main responsibility of every person in our society. Unfortunately, during the past decades, negligence in modern sustainable solutions has led to disastrous climate changes. If we do not find solutions to stop these tragic outcomes, these issues may deteriorate. Our solution tries to use modern approaches such as AI to help the environment, and we find this deeply meaningful. This model not only predicts the number of trees needed to be planted every year but also shows how these trees should be distributed around the world.

## What is the Problem?
The worldâ€™s leading climate scientists have warned there are only a dozen years for stopping global warming and climate change. The consequences of this catastrophic event are at least drought, floods, extreme heat, and poverty. Climate change includes both global warmings caused by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gasses and the resulting large-scale shift in weather patterns. The production of gases that cause the greenhouse effect is the most significant driver of warming. Carbon dioxide and methane, which lead to the greenhouse effect and global warming, are the two main threats to our environment.

Today, there are many organizations around the world which try to mitigate global warming consequences by planting. The goal of planting trees is amazing, but not enough. It is not precise and measurable. How many trees should be planted every year, month, and day to stop the tragic outcomes of greenhouse gases? Where should these trees be planted? Which places are in more danger? We should find the answers to these questions to make this goal achievable.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help us to find the answers. By gathering data from different environmental resources, AI models, which are able to find and predict the answers to these questions, can be trained and created. This is our goal!
