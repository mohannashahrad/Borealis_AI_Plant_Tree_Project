# Borealis_AI_Plant_Tree_Project

We believe saving the environment is the main responsibility of every person in our society. Unfortunately, during the past decades, negligence in modern sustainable solutions has led to disastrous climate changes. If we do not find solutions to stop these tragic outcomes, these issues may deteriorate. Our solution tries to use modern approaches such as AI to help the environment, and we find this deeply meaningful. This model not only predicts the number of trees needed to be planted every year but also shows how these trees should be distributed around the world.
